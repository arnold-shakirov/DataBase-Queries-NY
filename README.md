# Data Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project contains several Python scripts designed to perform various types of data analysis, including operations using NumPy, analysis of NYC Taxi data, and database queries. Each script performs a specific task, making it a versatile toolkit for data science projects.

## Features
- **NumPy Operations**: Demonstrates common array manipulations and operations using NumPy.
- **NYC Taxi Data Analysis**: Performs data analysis on NYC taxi trip data stored in Parquet format.
- **Database Querying**: Demonstrates how to query a database and manipulate the results for analysis.

## Project Structure
- **`numpy-operations.py`**: Contains examples of operations using the NumPy library, including array creation, manipulation, and basic statistical functions.
- **`nyctaxi-practice.py`**: Analyzes NYC taxi data, including fare analysis and trip count based on various features like payment type and date.
- **`query.py`**: Demonstrates database querying and result manipulation using Python.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy pyspark pyarrow
    ```

### Running the Scripts

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arnold-shakirov/DataBase-Ueries-NY.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Run the desired Python script:
    - **NumPy Operations**:
      ```bash
      python numpy-operations.py
      ```
    - **NYC Taxi Data Analysis**:
      ```bash
      python nyctaxi-practice.py
      ```
    - **Database Querying**:
      ```bash
      python query.py
      ```

### Output
Each script produces different outputs:
- **NumPy Operations**: Demonstrates various array manipulations and outputs the results of statistical operations on arrays.
- **NYC Taxi Data Analysis**: Prints out information on the columns in the dataset, average fares, and the number of trips by month.
- **Database Querying**: Outputs the results of queries made to a database and processes them for analysis.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x** or higher
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **PySpark**: For working with large datasets, specifically in Parquet format.
- **PyArrow**: For Parquet file processing.

### Installing Libraries
To install the required libraries, use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy pyspark pyarrow
```
